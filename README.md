SuggestionsX is a Minecraft plugin designed to let players create, view, and vote on server suggestions through an intuitive and interactive GUI. The system aims to make community feedback simple, organized, and engaging for both players and admins.


# currently still in development
My main goal right now is to finish the functionality of the plugin and then go through to hopefully optimize it.



### Main Menu GUI
Easily navigate through:

   Server-wide suggestions
   Your own suggestions
   Pending suggestions (admin-only)

### Fully Configurable Settings

   Customizable limit on the number of suggestions a player can make
   Editable GUI titles with color codes

### Data Management

   Individual player files to track personal suggestions
   A global suggestions file to manage all entries



# Perfect Scenario
 A player will create a suggestion with the command */sugg create* through chat.
 After the player has filled out the suggestion information, it will need to be reviewed by admin before being published for other players to see and vote for on the server.
 Once a suggestion is pending, it will either be **approved** or **denied**.
 Once a suggestion is approved, it will be added to the server suggestions page to be voted on by other players.


# Permissions
Permissions are currently in development.


# Commands
Commands are currently in development.


## Side Notes
   Players can view or delete their own suggestions at any time to check feedback or manage their submissions.

   OPs automatically have full administrative access by default.

   Once implemented, the permissions section will describe specific admin and player permission nodes.
