# SuggestionsX

## Just a more advanced version of SuggestionsPL   
###(currently still in development)
My main goal right now is to finish the functionality of the plugin and then go through to hopefully optimize it.

# Features
### - A main menu GUI to navigate: 
###   server suggestions
###   own suggestions 
###   pending suggestions (for admins)
### - Configurable limit of suggestions players can make.
### - Configurable GUI titles (with color codes).

# Perfect Scenario
### A player will create a suggestion with the command */sugg create* through chat.
### After the player has filled out the suggestion information, it will need to be reviewed by admin before being published for other players to see and vote for on the server.
### Once a suggestion is pending, it will either be **approved** or **denied**.
### Once a suggestion is approved, it will be added to the server suggestions page to be voted on by other players.

## Side Notes
### Players can view their own suggestions at any time to get real-time feedback on the status of their suggestions or if they wanted to delete any.
### By default, OP's will automatically have all permissions for admin for this plugin.
### Check permissions to see exactly which ones do what.
